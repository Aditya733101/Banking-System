# Banking-System

The provided C++ code for the bank management system already employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Here's a brief overview of how OOP concepts are used in the code:

Class Definition: The code defines a class named "Bank," which encapsulates the data and methods related to the bank management system.

Data Encapsulation: The class "Bank" encapsulates data members such as "total" and a structure named "person." These data members are declared as private, ensuring data encapsulation.

Constructor: The class "Bank" includes a constructor that initializes the "total" member when an object of the class is created.

Member Functions: The class "Bank" defines several member functions, such as "choice," "perData," "show," "update," "search," "transactions," and "del." These functions represent the behaviors and actions associated with the bank management system.

Data Abstraction: The data members within the "person" structure (name, ID, address, contact, cash) are abstractions representing the attributes of a person's account.

Method Encapsulation: Member functions are used to encapsulate and perform operations on the data members, providing a level of abstraction and separation of concerns.

Object Creation: In the "main" function, an object of the "Bank" class is created with the statement "Bank b." This object is used to interact with the bank management system
